# UX

Let's face it, our customers aren't thinking of AML compliance with the same fondness they might for their favourite social media platform.

As a reg tech application, our key differentiators do not need to be the look and feel of the application. Rather, they should be in the way we bring together core components and external services to deliver a streamlined user experience.

For that reason, we have adopted [Material Design](https://material.io) as our go-to design system. That is, every UI component, device, and affordance should be compliant with Material Design guidelines.

For developers, this means we aim to use [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com) components straight "out of the box" sans view-specific styling overrides.
