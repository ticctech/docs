# Progressive Disclosure

For Avid AML, we need to collect a certain amount of data to complete KYC for a customer. Rather than exposing a large form to a user, which can be overwhelming, we can use Progressive Disclosure to gently leads the user through a series of steps. We can also allow the user to partially complete their data and then highlight things that are missing when they return to the application.

## Stepper

We use the material stepper to lead a user through steps.
